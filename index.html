            <p>
                I am Sheikh Abdur Raheem Ali, an independent alignment research engineer based in Toronto.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Previously, I worked as a mid-level software engineer at Microsoft Security for three years. I was the youngest person ever hired at my level in Canada.</li>
                <li>I collaborated with some <a href="https://www.matsprogram.org/">MATS</a> scholars and mentors who were part of the Summer 2023 program.</li>
                <li>I was a research mentee for Berkeley AI Safety's <a href="https://sparai.org/">Supervised Program in Alignment Research</a> in Fall 2023 and returned as a project mentor for the Spring 2024 cohort.</li>
                <li>I was a visiting member of the <a href="https://www.safeai.org.uk/">London Initiative for Safe AI</a> during Summer 2024.</li>
                <li>I run the <a href="https://cognition.to/">CognitionTO</a> ML Paper Reading group.</li>
                <li>I bought Apple's Vision Pro on launch, and use enterprise APIs for visionOS to improve my productivity.</li>
                <li>I make unrestricted donations to promising early-career or student researchers, ranging from CAD $100-$200 immediately to USD $16.5k over four months.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I am from the United Arab Emirates; my father is a founder and businessman from India.

    <p>Most of my work is not available to the public. However, if you're interested in watching me code, I livestream programming sessions on <a href="https://twitch.com/sheikheddy">twitch.com/sheikheddy</a> every Friday evening.</p>
